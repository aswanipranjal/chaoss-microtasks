Hello! In this second microtask, we will chart the status(time open days, time to close days) of all the issues that were created in the last 6 months.

The analysis is in the Jupyter-Notebook.

---

We will start with choosing a repository to analyse. I am analysing [aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python.git)


Now start the Jupyter server and head over to the notebook for the analysis part. You can learn about Jupyter Notebooks [here](http://jupyter.org/).
