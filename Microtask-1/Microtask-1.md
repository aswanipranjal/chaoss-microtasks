Hello! In this microtask, we will try to list out all the new committers that commit to a repository each month and the number of commits that they do.

We will list out their names and the number of commits in a table using pandas and then we will store it in a csv file.
This is essentially what Microtask-1 is.

The analysis is in the Jupyter-Notebook.

We will start with choosing a repository to analyse. I am analysing [aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python.git)


Now start the Jupyter server and head over to the notebook for the analysis part. You can learn about Jupyter Notebooks [here](http://jupyter.org/).
