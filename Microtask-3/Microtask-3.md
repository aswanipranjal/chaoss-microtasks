Hello! In this mircotask, we have to: produce a listing of repositories, as a table and as CSV file, with the number of commits authored, issues opened, and pull requests opened, during the last three months, ordered by the total number (commits plus issues plus pull requests).

The analysis is in the Jupyter-Notebook.

This microtask is interesting because it asks us to co-relate 2 data sources with each other. We can analyse as many repositories as we want.


Now start the Jupyter server and head over to the notebook for the analysis part. You can learn about Jupyter Notebooks [here](http://jupyter.org/).
