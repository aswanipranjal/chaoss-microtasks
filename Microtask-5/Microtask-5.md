For this microtask, I produced 2 pull requests:
- The First one was to add a `Content-Type` header to the request that was being made to the Elasticsearch instance. This PR makes Manuscripts compatible with Elasticsearch-6. You can find it [here](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-manuscripts/pull/18).

- The Second PR changed the default name of the git enriched index from `git_enrich` to `git`. And it added the functionality for the user to be able to provide custom index names for the elasticsearch indices that they use while creating the reports. You can find it [here](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-manuscripts/pull/26).

This concludes the 5th microtask.
